description: Notes on Supercollider and my early forays into it
---

Exploring the world of Supercollider and music made with code, this is my journal that I've kept whilst delving into this fascinating area.

I recently came across Algoraves, Livecoding and a whole host of tools that can be used in isolation or as part of an existing music production setup. I had to get involved, this was too exciting and nerdy to ignore. I come across things
like this from time to time, that are too hard to miss out on. Thing is where do you begin?

The answer is Supercollider, start there and all of the other tools will fall into place.

Here is a quick list of those tools:

- SonicPi (which runs on it's own but does install Supercollider in the background)
- Tidal cycles
- Strudel
- FoxDot
- Salmon???

One evening I connected Supercollider to Logic and that was a lot of fun. I'll record some of these sessions to video and upload to YouTube, 3speak, Mastodon and Substack and the code will be shared here and on Github.

I've discovered some new videos that Eli Fieldstill has released on getting started:
